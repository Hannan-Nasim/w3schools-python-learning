# Variable Names
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).
# Rule for python variables:
"""
A variable name must start with a letter or underscore character.
A variable name can not start with a number.
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric charcters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _).
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords
"""
# Legal variable names:
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

# Illegal variable names:
# 2myvar = "John"
# my-var = "John"
# my var = "John"
