#Comments can be used to explain python code.
#Comments can be used to make code more readable.
#Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

# Creating a comment
# Comment starts with  a #, and python wil ignore them:
# This is a comment
print("I have commented everything above")

print("At the end of this line I have placed a comment and pythn will ignore it.") # See thi will not print cool cool man.

# A comment does not have to be the text that explains code, it can also be used to prevent python from executing code.
#print("This print statement will not be printed")

#Python has no multiline comment
#We have to insert # for each line
print("We have used more than one # as we don't have multiline comment in python")

#But but we can use multiline string.
#Since python ignore string literals taht are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes in your code)
"""
This  is a comment
written in 
more than just one line
"""
print("Multiline comment is used above")

"""
As long as the string is not assigned to a variable.
Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
